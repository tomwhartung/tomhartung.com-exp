## Running Drupal 8 in a Subdirectory

I was hoping it would be easy to run Drupal 8 in a subdirectory.

It **should** be easy to do, but I was unable to do it quickly, and
it is not important to achieve this goal at this time.

## References

If we decide that we do want to run drupal in a subdirectory,
here are some references we found that should help do this:

Moreover, I am not sure we want to continue running drupal....
